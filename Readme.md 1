Train Algorithm
  
The Training of the yolo algorithm has various stages,such as 

1) Cloning the github repository
2) Removing the images stored in training and test images folder.
2) Loading the custom dataset with labelled images into the training images folder
3) Loading the test images dataset to the test images folder
4) Specifying the tag names such as mask,non mask,social distance,no social distance
5) Convert the image annotations to yolo format.
6) Download the pretrained yolo weights to increase efficiency of prediction.
7) Then train the algorithm.

Cloning github repository

Step1: Clone the github repository into the notebook.

Step2: Change the directory to Content/TrainYourOwnYolo/Data/SourceImages

Step3: Remove all three folders named Training_Images, Test_Images, Test_ Image _ Detection_Results 

Step4: Recreate three folders with same name and save it.

Step5: Upload the vott-csv-export folder which is the labelled images with Annotations_export.csv file 

Step6: Upload the testing dataset to the Test_Images folder.

Step7: Navigate to Model_Weights folder  and go to data_classes.txt and put the tage names as mask,no mask,social distance,no social distance.

Step8: Navigate back to content/TrainYourOwnYolo directory.

Training the Algorithm 

Step1: Navigate back to /content/TrainYourOwnYolo directory.

Step2: Change the directory to 2_Training folder.

Step3: Download the pretrained yoloweights by running  the  python command  
!python Download_and_Convert_YOLO_weights.py

Step4: It takes some time to download the weights and then convert the weights to yolo format and applies the changes to the training dataset.

Step5: After the command gets over,type the next pyton command to train the algorithm with provided training dataset.
!python Train_YOLO.py

Step6: Once the training gets complete,navigate  to TrainYourOwnYolo folder.

Convert Annotations to Yolo format

Step1: Navigate back to /content/TrainYourOwnYolo directory
 
Step2: Change the directory to 1_Image_Annotation 

Step3: Run the python command as python Convert_to_YOLO_format.py

Step4: The step3 would convert the annotations which are loaded in data folder to yolo format.

Test Algorithm

The Algorithm is now tested for its accuracy of prediction and the learning rate and confidence score applied to the test results.

Testing the Algorithm
Step1: Navigate to 3_Inference folder

Step2: Run the python command python Detector.py

Step3: The Algorithm applies its learning rate,detects the learnt boxes over the predicted objects with the confidence score.

Step4: The Algorithm's test results will be stored inside the Test_Image_Detection_Results folder.
